Final Project for CS 335 - Our goal is to make a server/client architecture that is both general purpose and provides a positive user experience. The program will allow for users to sign up to access the server, sign in with their credentials, and retrieve them if anything goes wrong. The program will allow admins to make queries to the program and get information about prespecified commands. The program will be multithreaded so as to allow multiple users to interact with and be logged into the server at any given time. Most of the contents shown below are based on the contents of our Server/Client Architecture Documentation, which was created in the Fall Semester of 2021. There are no further plans to update this project, all collaborators are mentioned in the Proposal section. Uses Java and SQL. More Details can be found with here: https://www.agnorokdomain.com/all-posts/ClientServer

All the code for the Tetris game in place of the Business logic for the application belongs exclusively to Ben Sottile.

Thank you Ben and David :)
